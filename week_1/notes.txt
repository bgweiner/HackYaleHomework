We use CSS to make things pretty and consistent

selectors: refer to div, .invisible , #foobar (from most to least general)

CLass and Id descriptors

ids are unique to each div
id="foobar"
class="invisible"
or <div id="foobar" class="invisible>
class is a property you apply to a group 

Lists:
<ul>
 <li>...

</ul>

call it style.css (or whatever)
 Add it with <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"">
in <head>

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
</head>
use ./ or not at all on ours!
